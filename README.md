## Worried about costs?
There is __[no way](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?threadID=58127)__ to automatically limit your costs in AWS.

Costs incurred above the $100 credit are __automatically charged__ to your registered credit card!

Here are some tips to keep you under budget!

* __STOP__ Your instance when you're not using them
    * Do __NOT Terminate__, you will lose all your work.
    * Start them again when you want to work again. __Warning:__ IP address could change after restart!

* TERMINATE __only__ when all your data has been migrated out of the instance / you are finished with the assignment.
* Use [Billing Alarms](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/free-tier-alarms)
* Create an Idle alarm
